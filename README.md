# Quality

In a nutshell, the goal of this program is to upload and store a list of words (which represent qualities) and their definitions, and search for the links among their definitions. 
(The concept of linked lists and pointers in C may be valuable, since it allows for the free association, insertion, reconnection, and ordering of nodes, which in this case would be words.)

Words define each other. They comprise the “necessary and sufficient” matrix of qualities that define each other. 
Or, they may have other patterns of association – not necessarily defining one another, but coming together in other ways that produce meaning or value.

The ultimate goal to is to detect and express combinations of qualities, objects, ideas, or “data structures” that produce or exhibit what we call “good” or are said to “have quality” – information and objects that are valuable, substantial, and enduring.

## Underlying Hierarchy – A Note about the Structure of Perception and Reality

(Note that capitalization is used in this discussion to carefully differentiate between words representing the principle or source of good, which Robert Pirsig taught me to call **Quality** (capitalized) and the outcomes of that principle, which we call **qualities** (not capitalized). 
This mode of capitalization allows us to differentiate between the principle **Intelligence** and the qualities it perceives and produces, which are also called **intelligence**. 
In the case of quality, capitalization and non-capitalization allows us to more clearly discuss three intertwined concepts:  

1. **Quality** as the principle, source, or pattern-making Intelligence behind goodness, 
2. **quality** as having goodness or value, and 
3. **quality** as an attribute that may or may not have intrinsic value, but becomes valuable in the right combination and proportion with other qualities.

The following hierarchy begins with the smallest, root element of perception called **quality** (as attribute) and works its way up through larger informational and perceptual structures, ultimating in the principle **Quality** that produces, holds, and governs its manifestations or reflections.

### Hierarchy Overview

- **quality (as attribute)**: A tangible or intangible attribute (e.g., red, smooth, new, improbable, spontaneous).
- **object or idea**: A structured combination of qualities. 
- **pattern**: A combination of qualities, objects, or events that follow a spatial, temporal, or metaphysical rule.
- **quality (as excellence)**: Excellence, value, meaning, goodness, usefulness.
- **Quality**: The Principle or Intelligence behind the production, identification, and maintenance of qualities.

## Synonyms

- **quality (as attribute)**: property, characteristic, trait, talent, state, condition, feature, defined pattern.
- **object**: thing, item, node.
- **idea**: concept, conception, vision.
- **pattern**: architecture, structure, format, theme.
- **quality (as excellence)**: goodness, intelligence, coherence and stability, permanently unfolding; harmonious, beneficial, successful, sustainable, contributory, profitable, substantial, conscious, pure.
- **Quality (as Principle)**: Principle, Origin, Good, Intelligence, Harmony, Mind, Source, Substance, Pattern-Maker, Being, Truth, Wisdom, Field, Unified Field, Universe.

## Summary

When certain shapes and patterns come together, they have **quality (as excellence)**. 
That quality comes in an infinite number of forms and may be described by a wide variety of words, such as beautiful, useful, informative, meaningful, and so on. 

The goal of this program is to find, record, experiment, and play with static patterns of quality and the channels through which dynamic quality flows. 
By defining and understanding qualities, along with their relationships and movements, we are able to create better products, improve our thoughts, and build better relationships. 

In short, understanding good has the effect of improving and strengthening our thoughts, practices, and products.

The ocean of Quality and its tributaries passes uses and includes science, linguistics, art, meditative listening, and many other disciplines. 
It is both physical and metaphysical. It embraces both form and meaning, and their symbols. 
You should not try to explore to Quality if you are biased toward either “classical or romantic” interpretations. 
Dualistic classifications, such as “mental and physical” or “analytical and holistic” lose their meaning in Quality. 

**Quality** is the place where poetry and programming truly overlap.
