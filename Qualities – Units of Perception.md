# Qualities – Units of Perception

#### A Scientific Statement of Qualities

The fundamental building blocks of information and perception, and therefore, for all practical purposes, *reality*, are *qualities*.

Objects and their relations are composed of qualities, not atoms. Atoms themselves are composed of qualities. Qualities can be defined in many ways, but one is: "patterns of substance, information, and perception." 

We say, "These objects, forces, and movements have structure." But *structure* is a *quality*. We say that structures are solid, liquid, and aeriform, but each of those states is a quality – or, viewed from another vantage point, a collection of qualities. You distinguish states of matter (so-called) by their qualities.

Again, qualities are the fundamental building blocks of perception. Qualities are *units* of consciousness. Though qualities are units, they have their own qualities. (That's how definitions work.) 

If qualities are harmonious, they are simultaneiously real and enduring. Harmony, endurance, and reality are practically synonymous.  If a quality is inharmonious, it is a *broken* pattern, which is a non-pattern. A pattern of non-pattern is a self-defeating concept and fundamentally unreal.
